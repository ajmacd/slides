# Cross-platform C++ development with WebRTC

## A bit of history

Slack Calls in the Mac native app.
* MacGap, basically a WebKit wrapper, used as a single-site browser to run the Slack webapp.

* But! No access to WebRTC.

---
## A bit of history

JavaScript implementation for Chrome and C++ library were developed together.

[*Diagram of application logic handled partly in UI layer. Didn't have a clear separation of concerns.*]

API was pretty low-level. A few methods, passing JSON messages directly from our media server.

This worked fine for desktop. Our team was handling much of the development.

---

## A bit of history

Trouble appeared as we expanded to mobile.
* Platform developers had to reimplement domain-specific application logic.

* A lot of parsing raw JSON messages from the media server.

---

## Reimagine the approach

What is the ideal cross-platform design?

**Write-once, run-anywhere**

* Consolidates features (and bugs) in one place.

* Insulates platform developers from details they shouldn't care about.

**Provide a natural API**

* Choose the right level of abstraction.

* Platform-specific language bindings to make it natural to use.

---

## Our approach

Application logic in modern C++...
* The native WebRTC libs are C++.

* `>= C++11` is a fairly painless experience (occasionally delightful!).

...with an API written in [Dropbox's Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni).

* Uses a simple interface definition language.

* Generates cross-platform bindings for `Java` and `Obj-C` <-> `C++`.

Djinni IDL
```python
session = interface +c {
  static create(observer : session_observer,
                room_api_json : string) : session;

  # Start up media streams and join the room.
  join_room();
}
```

Java
```java
public abstract class Session {
    @Nullable
    public static native Session create(@Nullable SessionObserver observer,
                                        @NonNull String roomApiJson);

    /** Start up media streams and join the room. */
    public abstract void joinRoom();
}
```

Objective-C
```objc
@interface LCSession : NSObject

+ (nullable LCSession *)observer:(nullable id<LCSessionObserver>)observer
                     roomApiJson:(nonnull NSString *)roomApiJson;

/** Start up media streams and join the room. */
- (void)joinRoom;
```

---

Djinni IDL
```python
session_observer = interface +o +j {
  # Called when the client has finished joining the room, in response to
  # join_room() or following on_room_rejoining().
  # UI: show the self avatar and peer avatars, all with spinners.
  on_room_joined(response : room_joined_response, peers : list<peer>);
}
```

C++
```cpp
class SessionObserver {
public:
    virtual ~SessionObserver() {}

    /**
     * Called when the client has finished joining the room, in response to
     * join_room() or following on_room_rejoining().
     * UI: show the self avatar and peer avatars, all with spinners.
     */
    virtual void on_room_joined(RoomJoinedResponse response,
                                const std::vector<Peer> & peers) = 0;
};
```
---

## Lessons learned
Level of abstraction for the API?

**Base it around UI actions and updates.**

```python
# Events related to remote "peer" clients.
peer_event = enum {
  # A peer has joined the room.
  # UI: show the peer's avatar with a spinner.
  joined;

  # A peer has left the room entirely.
  # UI: remove the peer's avatar.
  left;

  # A peer has muted their outgoing audio stream.
  # UI: show a muted icon on the peer's avatar.
  audio_muted;

  # The media stream from a peer is suffering from poor network conditions.
  # UI: show a warning about the peer's network, possibly as an icon on the
  #     peer's avatar.
  bad_network;
}
```

---

## Lessons learned

Threading model

Assume the UI thread is hitting the library. Make all heavy methods async.

```cpp
void SessionImpl::leave_room() {
  msg_thread_->post([this] {
    SyncLeaveRoom();
    log_sender_.reset();
    shutdown_complete_ = true;
    observer_->on_room_left();
  });
}

void SessionImpl::SyncLeaveRoom() {
  RTC_DCHECK(msg_thread_->is_current_thread());
  msg_thread_->disable();
  connection_monitor_->Clear();
  ...
}
```
JVM gets upset when accessed by non-Java created threads. Use a thread launcher.

[mx3](https://github.com/libmx3/mx3):
Example project showing Djinni best practices.

[Mobile CPP Slack team](https://mobilecpp.slack.com): A good place for questions.

---

## Alternatives we considered
RPC frameworks
* [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)

* [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)

Offers cross-platform API generation (even JavaScript!)

Isn't a great fit for the domain: not designed for running in process (maybe GRPC?).

---

## Conceptually similar efforts

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/) + [j2objc](http://j2objc.org/)
* Write once in Java and transpile to JavaScript and Obj-C.

---

## Two reasonable architectures

Do you have Java/Obj-C mobile apps already?

### C++/Djinni

Do you have a WebRTC web app, and are building mobile apps?

### JavaScript + React Native

---

## Case study

[Reconnection logic, placeholder]

---

## But, you still have to write it twice!
We have a plan (sort of): [Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/)
