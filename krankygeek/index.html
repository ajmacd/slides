# Cross-platform C++ development and WebRTC

.center[<img src="c-seeklogo.com.svg" alt="C++ logo" style="width: 50px;"/> <img src="webrtc-logo-vert-retro-dist.svg" alt="WebRTC logo" style="width: 50px;"/>]


???
* Experiences with shipping a cross-platform webrtc product and things we've learnd.

## Brief architecture tour
.center[<img src="system-architecture.svg" alt="System architecture" style="width: 650px;"/>]

???
* All media traffic passes through our media server, even in 1:1 calls.

* Focus is on group calling. We want to encourage group calls and assume any 1:1 call could be upgraded.

* Smooth handover from p2p to server based call is hard.

* However, there are clear user benefits in some contexts; someone WFH in the same city as their office for example.

* We want to adopt this eventually.

* Starting a call: client contacts region server to discover which media server they'll be closest to.

* Call state is stored in Slack's DB. Client talks to the REST API to create/join calls. Returns the media server to talk to and IDs.

* After that, all signalling passes through the media server.

* Some Slack client updates come via the RTM API.

## WebRTC client stack

.center[<img src="app-stack.svg" alt="WebRTC stack" style="width: 400px;"/>]

???
* I want to focus on cross-platform client development today.

* I'm also assuming you've rolled your own webrtc binaries, referring to that as native webrtc.

* Super simplified client stack: break it down into three components.

---

## WebRTC client stack

.center[<img src="app-stack-highlight.svg" alt="WebRTC stack" style="width: 400px;"/>]

???
* Want to discuss the application logic layer, and its interface to the UI layer.

---

## A bit of history

Audio calls in the Slack Mac native app.
* Based on MacGap, a WebKit wrapper.

* But! No access to WebRTC.

???
* Based on MacGap, a WebKit wrapper, used as a single-site browser container to run the Slack webapp.

* No webrtc, so we needed to roll our own webrtc binaries.

---

## A bit of history

Browser and Desktop implementations were developed together.

.left[<img src="client-stack-desktop.svg" alt="Client stack" style="width: 480;"/>]

---

## A bit of history

Browser and Desktop implementations were developed together.

.left[<img src="client-stack-desktop-highlight.svg" alt="Client stack" style="width: 480;"/>]

???
* Because the two were developed in tandem by the same team, the application logic ended up being spread across JS and C++.

* API was pretty low-level. A few weakly-typed methods, passing JSON messages directly from our media server.

* This worked fine for desktop. Our team was handling much of the development.

---

## A bit of history

Trouble appeared as we expanded to mobile.

.left[<img src="client-stack-mobile-then.svg" alt="Client stack" style="width: 745px;"/>]

???
* Platform developers had to reimplement domain-specific application logic.

* A lot of parsing raw JSON messages from the media server.

* We launched on mobile in this state, but it slowed progress. And adding features later would continue to be costly.

---

## Reimagine the approach

What is the ideal cross-platform design?

**Write-once, run-anywhere.**

**Provide a natural API to platform developers.**

???
* So, after launch, decided to reimagine the approach.

* Consolidates features (and bugs) in one place.

* Insulates platform developers from details they shouldn't care about.

* Choose the right level of abstraction.

* Platform-specific language bindings to make it natural to use.

* Strongly typed, to move a certain class of errors from run-time to compile-timer errors.

---

## Reimagine the approach

.left[<img src="client-stack-mobile-now.svg" alt="Client stack" style="width: 745px;"/>]

???

* With this, we would consolidate application logic solidly in one layer.

---

## Our selection

Application logic in modern C++...
* Native WebRTC libs are C++.

* C++11 is a fairly painless experience.

...with an API written in [Dropbox's Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni).
* Uses a simple interface definition language.

* Generates bindings for Java and Obj-C <-> C++.

???
* Handles all data marshalling between languages.

---

## Alternatives we considered
RPC frameworks
* [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)

* [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)

`+` Offers cross-platform API generation.

`-` Isn't a great fit for the domain.

???
* Offers cross-platform API generation, even for JavaScript.

* Not designed for running in process, maybe GRPC?

* Thrift especially is pretty heavy-weight. There's an Microsoft project called Thrify intended for Android that reduces the number of classes it generates.

### Djinni IDL
```python
session = interface +c {
  static create(observer : session_observer,
                room_api_json : string) : session;

  # Start up media streams and join the room.
  join_room();
}
```

```java
public abstract class Session {
    @Nullable
    public static native Session create(@Nullable SessionObserver observer,
                                        @NonNull String roomApiJson);

    /** Start up media streams and join the room. */
    public abstract void joinRoom();
}
```

```objc
@interface LCSession : NSObject

+ (nullable LCSession *)observer:(nullable id<LCSessionObserver>)observer
                     roomApiJson:(nonnull NSString *)roomApiJson;

/** Start up media streams and join the room. */
- (void)joinRoom;
```

???
* Here is the Djinni interface definition language. Very easy to use. Generates Java and Obj-C.

* These are just the interfaces, with a bunch of intermediate generated code to handle the data marshalling.

* For anyone who's written JNI by hand, you can imagine how nice this is.

---

###Djinni IDL
```python
session_observer = interface +o +j {
  # Called when the client has finished joining the room, in response to
  # join_room() or following on_room_rejoining().
  # UI: show the self avatar and peer avatars, all with spinners.
  on_room_joined(response : room_joined_response, peers : list<peer>);
}
```

```cpp
class SessionObserver {
public:
    virtual ~SessionObserver() {}

    /**
     * Called when the client has finished joining the room, in response to
     * join_room() or following on_room_rejoining().
     * UI: show the self avatar and peer avatars, all with spinners.
     */
    virtual void on_room_joined(RoomJoinedResponse response,
                                const std::vector<Peer> & peers) = 0;
};
```
---

## `$ wc -l`

Djinni generated &gt;5k lines of code for us.

???
* At current count, Djinni generated more than 5k lines of boilerplate code for us.

* More importantly, we don't have to sift through all of that when we make a change.

---

## Lessons learned
Level of abstraction for the API?

**Base it around UI actions and events.**

```python
# Events related to remote "peer" clients.
peer_event = enum {
  # A peer has joined the room.
  # UI: show the peer's avatar with a spinner.
  joined;

  # A peer has left the room entirely.
  # UI: remove the peer's avatar.
  left;

  # A peer has muted their outgoing audio stream.
  # UI: show a muted icon on the peer's avatar.
  audio_muted;

  # The media stream from a peer is suffering from poor network conditions.
  # UI: show a warning about the peer's network, possibly as an icon on the
  #     peer's avatar.
  bad_network;
}
```

???
* Probably obvious in retrospect, but it became very clear that we should base the API around UI events.

* There will be layout differences of course, but the essential calling UI elements are retained on all platforms.

* It's a very natural way for the platform developers to interact with the library: a user takes a certain action and it results in me calling a library method. The library's callback observer has a method called which results in a UI update.

---

## Lessons learned

**Threading model**

Assume the UI thread is hitting the library.

```cpp
void SessionImpl::leave_room() {
  msg_thread_->post([this] {
    SyncLeaveRoom();
    log_sender_.reset();
    shutdown_complete_ = true;
    observer_->on_room_left();
  });
}

void SessionImpl::SyncLeaveRoom() {
  RTC_DCHECK(msg_thread_->is_current_thread());
  msg_thread_->disable();
  connection_monitor_->Clear();
  ...
}
```
JVM gets upset when accessed by non-Java created threads.

???
* Make all heavy methods asynchronous. We decided to make _all_ methods async to make the threading model easier: all top-layer methods are posted to a single background thread.

* Create platform-specific threads.

---

## Resources

**mx3**: Example project showing Djinni best practices.
https://github.com/libmx3/mx3

**Mobile C++ Slack community team**: A good place for questions.
https://mobilecpp.slack.com

???
* mx3: has implementations of useful objects like platform-specific UI thread event loops and thread launchers.

* The mobile C++ slack community team is fairly active, including some Dropbox developers who worked on Djinni. Good place to get your questions answered.

## Case study: reconnection logic

Call survey results for Android client

.left[<img src="android-survey-results.png" alt="Android survey results" style="width: 750px;"/>]

???
* Version 2.19 of the Android client included the new library which consolidated logic.

* Unintended consequence: we saw the rate of disconnects drop significantly and the approval or "ok" rating climb.

* I attribute this to implementing the logic on our team, who very well understood the requirements.

---

## Two alternative architectures

Do you have Java/Obj-C mobile apps already?

### C++/Djinni

Do you have a WebRTC web app, and are building mobile apps?

### JavaScript + React Native

???
* I think there are two classes of architectures that would work in this domain.

---

## But, you still have to write it twice!

---

## But, you still have to write it twice!

.left[<img src="client-stack-emscripten.svg" alt="Client stack" style="width: 745px;"/>]

We have a plan (sort of): [Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/)

???
* Emscripten is a C++ to JS transpiler.

* We have some patches to Djinni that will produce Emscripten bindings.

* Not developed yet, but if we end up doing this, I'm sure we'll write a blog post or something. So stay tuned.
